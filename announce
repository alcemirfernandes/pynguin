Pynguin is a python-based turtle graphics application.
    It combines an editor, interactive interpreter, and
    graphics display area.

It is meant to be an easy environment for introducing
    some programming concepts to beginning programmers.

This release continues to refine the interaction between
    the code-running threads and the main thread. Please
    report any strange behaviors, crashes, or freezes!


Pynguin is tested with Python 2.6.5 and uses PyQt (4.7.2)
    for its GUI elements. Pynguin is released under GPLv3.
