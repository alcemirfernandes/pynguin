Pynguin is a python-based turtle graphics application.
    It combines an editor, interactive interpreter, and
    graphics display area.

It is meant to be an easy environment for introducing
    some programming concepts to beginning programmers.

This release changes the method of starting and stopping
    the separate code-running threads. It should be much
    less susceptible to lock-ups and crashes, though I
    am still experiencing occasional problems.


Pynguin is tested with Python 2.6.4 and uses PyQt (4.6)
    for its GUI elements. Pynguin is released under GPLv3.


Changes in pynguin-0.8:
    - add support for pygments syntax highlighting
