Pynguin is a python-based turtle graphics application.
    It combines an editor, interactive interpreter, and
    graphics display area.

It is meant to be an easy environment for introducing
    some programming concepts to beginning programmers.

This release ports Pynguin to Python 3.


Pynguin is tested with Python 3.2.3 and PyQt 4.9.3 and
    will use Pygments syntax highlighting if available.

Pynguin is released under GPLv3.


Changes in pynguin-0.13:
    Now uses (requires) Python 3
        - Tested with Python 3.2.3

    Important fixes
        - New approach for threading of user code
            - should provide safer, more reliable, termination of user code

    Pynguin API
        - Logo-mode coordinates and angles now available
        - Python turtle-mode coordinates and angles now available
        - xy(x, y) re-uses goto(x, y) code
        - xyh() uses xy() and h() to retrieve values
        - color() takes an optional alpha channel value for transparency
            - color('ralpha') chooses a random color with random alpha
