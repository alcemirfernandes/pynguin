Pynguin is a python-based turtle graphics application.
    It combines an editor, interactive interpreter, and
    graphics display area.

It is meant to be an easy environment for introducing
    some programming concepts to beginning programmers.

This release continues adding basic functionality and
    refining the interface. If you are interested, please
    take a look and let me know what you think.


Pynguin is tested with Python 2.6.4 and uses PyQt (4.6)
    for its GUI elements. Pynguin is released under GPLv3.


Changes in pynguin-0.5:
    - catch errors when processing graphic move queue
    - capture and hold stdout and stderr
    - call str() on argument to write
    - guard against sending non-int to color
