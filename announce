Pynguin is a python-based turtle graphics application.
    It combines an editor, interactive interpreter, and
    graphics display area.

It is meant to be an easy environment for introducing
    some programming concepts to beginning programmers.

This release has focused on improvements to usabilty and
    user-friendliness, with much input and many reports
    from actual users. Thanks Alec! There is a huge list
    of bug fixes and new features.


Pynguin is tested with Python 2.7.1 and PyQt 4.8.3 and
    will use Pygments syntax highlighting if available.

Pynguin is released under GPLv3.
