Pynguin is a python-based turtle graphics application.
    It combines an editor, interactive interpreter, and
    graphics display area.

It is meant to be an easy environment for introducing
    some programming concepts to beginning programmers.

This release continues to expand basic functionality and
    explores more user-friendly options in the interface.


Pynguin is tested with Python 2.7.1 and PyQt 4.8.3 and
    will use Pygments syntax highlighting if available.

Pynguin is released under GPLv3.


Changes in pynguin-0.10:
    Session
        - can now save to or load from directory instead of a file
        - remember drawing speed between sessions

    Pynguin API
        - allow setting drawing speed from code
        - add xyforward(dist) method to return coords dist ahead of pynguin
        - reset() is more thorough restoring pynguin to initial state
        - handle input() and raw_input() properly
        - simple onclick() handler only affects the main pyguin
            - onclick() responds to right-click now (not left-click)

        - recenter canvas on home() and reset()
        - fix crash on startup when pynguin tracking is enabled
        - all canvas related shortcuts now use Alt-<key>

        - added warning when removing page with menu option

        - added shortcut for Test/run code

    Integrated Console

    Examples
        - improved threaded examples

                get cursor back to do something else in a new thread
        - improved multi examples
            - implements the same bugs() example as the threaded
