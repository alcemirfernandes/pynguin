Reload drawing when loading session?
Focus follows mouse?
Icons for menu items
Toolbar?
Use QGraphicsItemAnimation for animation?
Create a non-graphical turtle library?
Show all available commands in a menu
Undo
Separate the editor part
Sometimes console gets out of sync
Paren matching
Need to check types being passed to methods that will later
    be passed through to delayed graphic draw methods so that
    error messages will be seen at the right place.
Add ability to "lock" documents in to place
Use arcs instead of lines when slow drawing circles
Replace squares with QGraphicsRectItem when finished (like circles)
Pygments color in interactive console area
property access for color and fill?
Pynguin subclass (Turtle?) that uses turtle.py API
color(None) for transparent line?
Ability to keep handle on drawn items, move them, use them as avatar.
Test/Run all sometimes gets stuck trying to start
pressing Enter at beginning of already indented line should keep indentation
Adding ModeTurtle is including helper in pynguins?
Adding ModeLogo is making a phantom pynguin!
find in editor pages
segfault occasionally when using labels... argh!
pynguins list needs a runtime analog so that running code sees the current
    list of pynguins and display code can see its own list.
adjust default backup file name for legacy installs
move interpreter prompts to margin?
elipses/eliptical arcs
mode change is losing track of a pynguin
increase/decrease font size in console?
Switch command line processing to something more sane (argparse)
fill(False) synonym for nofill() ?
prompt not displayed after syntax error in console (sometimes...)
